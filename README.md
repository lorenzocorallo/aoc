# Advent Of Code

My own resolution to [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about)
problems (used to learn Rust).

## Info
* I'm using the `bin` folder inside `src` to code every "day" of the aoc
(`day1.rs`, `day2.rs`, ...) .  
* To run the specific day `cargo run --bin day{n}` where `n` stands 
for the day number.  
* There are two types of input files `.test` and `.prod` where the first uses
the already solved input provided by aoc and the second one uses the input
that needs to be solved for passing the day.
* [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/aoc) as reference/inspiration
for the Rust learning.
